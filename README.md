# Textual-similarity-computation
In this app, we will find the textual similarity between two sentences or documents using word embeddings and cosine similarity.

# Introduction
Text Similarity aims to indentify how similar documents are on a word level. 
Essesntially we may define text similarity as attempting to determine how close 2 documents are in lexical similarity and semantic similarity.
The goal is to have a vector space where similar documenst are "close" according to a chosen similarity measure.

# Project Flow

1) Build different kinds of functions that will help us in document preprocessing and convert data into vectorized formats.

2) Build a web app on Django to mount the similarity model.

3) Deploy the django project on heroku through github.
